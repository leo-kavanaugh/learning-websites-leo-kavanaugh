A <strong>love triangle</strong> tale with a ton of atmosphere and texture and imagery

<p></p>
I believe that you heard your master sing
when I was sick in bed.<br>
I suppose that he told you everything
that I keep locked away in my head.<br>
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said.<br>
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner <em>wine and bread?</em>
<p></p>

You met him at some temple, where
they take your clothes at the door. <br>
He was just a numberless man in a chair
who'd just come back from the war. <br>
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
and he hands you the apple core. <br>
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
of all the kisses we put on some time before.
<p></p>

And he gave you a <em>German Shepherd</em> to walk
with a collar of leather and nails,<br>
and he never once made you explain or talk
about all of the little details,<br>
such as who had a word and who had a rock,
and who had you through the mails.<br>
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
and it never stops not even when your master fails.

<p></p>

And he took you up in his aeroplane,
which he flew without any hands,<br>
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
that drove the crowd from the stands.<br>
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
and, an ape with angel glands,<br>
erased the final wisps of pain
with the music of rubber bands.
<p></p>

And now I hear your master sing,
you kneel for him to come.<br>
His body is a <em>golden string</em>
that your body is hanging from.<br>
His body is a <em>golden string</em>,
my body has grown numb.<br>
Oh now you hear your master sing,
your shirt is all undone.
<p></p>

<p></p>

And will you kneel beside this bed
that we polished so long ago,<br>
before your master chose instead
to make my bed of snow?<br>
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
and you're speaking far too low.<br>
No I can't make out what your master said
before he made you go.
<p></p>

Then I think you're playing far too rough
for a lady who's been to the moon;<br>
I've lain by this window long enough
to get used to an empty room.<br>
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
who is tapping his foot to a tune,<br>
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
let's say you came back some time too soon.

I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.<br>
He was starving in some deep mystery
like a man who is sure what is true.<br>
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,<br>
and I taught him how you would long for me
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do.
<p></p>

I believe that you heard your master sing
while I was sick in bed,<br>
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.<br>
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said,<br>
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner <em>wine and bread?</em>

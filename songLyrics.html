<h7>A <strong>love triangle</strong> tale with a ton of atmosphere and texture and imagery</h7>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h7>I believe that you heard your master sing
    when I was sick in bed.<br>
    I suppose that he told you everything
    that I keep locked away in my head.<br>
    Your master took you travelling,
    well at least that's what you said.<br>
    And now do you come back to bring
    your prisoner <em>wine and bread?</em><h7/>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>
<h7>You met him at some temple, where
    they take your clothes at the door. <br>
    He was just a numberless man in a chair
    who'd just come back from the war. <br>
    And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
    and he hands you the apple core. <br>
    Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
    of all the kisses we put on some time before.</h7>
    <p></p>

<h7>And he gave you a <em>German Shepherd</em> to walk
    with a collar of leather and nails,<br>
    and he never once made you explain or talk
    about all of the little details,<br>
    such as who had a word and who had a rock,
    and who had you through the mails.<br>
    Now your love is a secret all over the block,
    and it never stops not even when your master fails.</h7>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>
<h7>And he took you up in his aeroplane,
    which he flew without any hands,<br>
    and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
    that drove the crowd from the stands.<br>
    Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
    and, an ape with angel glands,<br>
    erased the final wisps of pain
    with the music of rubber bands.</h7>
    <p></p>

<h7>And now I hear your master sing,
    you kneel for him to come.<br>
    His body is a <em>golden string</em>
    that your body is hanging from.<br>
    His body is a <em>golden string</em>,
    my body has grown numb.<br>
    Oh now you hear your master sing,
    your shirt is all undone.</h7>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>
<h7>And will you kneel beside this bed
    that we polished so long ago,<br>
    before your master chose instead
    to make my bed of snow?<br>
    Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
    and you're speaking far too low.<br>
    No I can't make out what your master said
    before he made you go.</h7>
    <p></p>

<h7>Then I think you're playing far too rough
    for a lady who's been to the moon;<br>
    I've lain by this window long enough
    to get used to an empty room.<br>
    And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
    who is tapping his foot to a tune,<br>
    and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
    let's say you came back some time too soon.</h7>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>
<h7>I loved your master perfectly
    I taught him all that he knew.<br>
    He was starving in some deep mystery
    like a man who is sure what is true.<br>
    And I sent you to him with my guarantee
    I could teach him something new,<br>
    and I taught him how you would long for me
    no matter what he said no matter what you'd do.</h7>
    <p></p>

<h7>I believe that you heard your master sing
    while I was sick in bed,<br>
     I'm sure that he told you everything
    I must keep locked away in my head.<br>
    Your master took you travelling,
    well at least that's what you said,<br>
    And now do you come back to bring
    your prisoner <em>wine and bread?</em><h7/>
